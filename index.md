## Cheng Cheng
I am currently a research fellow at School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University. I used to be a postdoctorate at Duke University and Samsi mentored by Ingrid Daubechies. I am currently working on applied and harmonic analysis including phase retrieval, graph signal processing, sampling theory.
